## It's a map!

It's a map is a simple map site built on Laravel using Mapbox. This is meant as a code test for myself, to see where I'm up to right now. If you like my steez, feel free to gmail me at abrahambrookes@

### The App
Display a map of your favourite places to your friends. Create map markers, upload images and describe each map location in a nifty little digital map.

#### Features
 - Create maps using the map editor. Each map will have its own url (using dynamic routing a'la Laravel)
 - Add map pointers to your map (using Eloquent models)
 - Upload an image for your map pointer (using Filestack)
 - Edit your map with a cute little drag n drop interface (using MapboxGL-js)
